# Simulate losing a minority of zookeepers by killing `zk1`:
$ vagrant ssh zk1 -- sudo stop zookeeper

# Try running a basic `zk` operation, it should work fine:
$ vagrant ssh go
$ zk children /
zookeeper

# Try writing and then reading the write, it should work fine:
$ echo "hello" | zk create /sim-lost-minority
$ zk get /sim-lost-minority
hello
$ zk delete /sim-lost-minority
$ zk exists /sim-lost-minority
n
