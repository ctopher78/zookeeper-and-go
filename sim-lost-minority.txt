# Simulate losing a minority of zookeepers by killing `zk`:
$ vagrant ssh zk1 -- sudo stop zookeeper

# Try running a basic `zk` operation, it should work fine:
$ vagrant ssh go
$ zk children /
zookeeper

# Try writing and then reading the write, it should work fine:
$ echo "hello" | zk create /world
$ zk get /world
hello
$ zk delete /world
$ zk exists /world
n
