# Simulate losing a minority of zookeepers by killing `zk1`:
$ docker stop zookeeper.1

# Try running a basic `zk` operation, it should work fine:
$ /bin/go-console
$ zk children /
zookeeper

# Try writing and then reading the write, it should work fine:
$ echo "hello" | zk create /sim-lost-minority
$ zk get /sim-lost-minority
hello
$ zk delete /sim-lost-minority
$ zk exists /sim-lost-minority
n

# To restore, rebuild the VM:
$ docker ps -a | tail -n +2 | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xargs -n 1 docker rm -f
$ /vagrant/vm.sh
