# Start a looping client operation to observe disconnection effects:
$ /bin/go-console
$ go run /vagrant/ex-loop.go

# Simulate disconnecting a minority of zookeepers by partitioning
# `zookeeper.1`:
$ ifconfig | grep pl | head -n 1
$ ifconfig $INTERFACE down

# The client should continue to loop fine.
